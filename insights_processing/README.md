# Jira Product Discovery – Insights Processor

## Overview

The Jira Product Discovery – Insights Processor is an AI-powered system designed to process and analyze Jira Product Discovery (JPD) items, extract meaningful insights, and enable semantic search capabilities through vector embeddings. This agent transforms raw JPD data into structured, searchable insights that help product managers make data-driven decisions.

## Purpose

This agent serves as a comprehensive JPD data processing and insights generation tool that:

- Extracts and processes Jira Product Discovery items and their metadata
- Converts complex JPD data structures into searchable text representations
- Generates vector embeddings for semantic similarity search
- Enables intelligent querying of product insights using Pinecone vector database
- Provides structured analysis of product discovery items and their relationships

## Key Features

### 1. JPD Data Extraction and Processing
The agent processes Jira Product Discovery items including:
- **Basic Information**: Key, summary, description, status
- **Custom Fields**: Value, impact, demand, effort, customer priority
- **Linked Issues**: Discovery items, delivery items, and connections
- **Rich Content**: ADF (Atlassian Document Format) content parsing
- **Metadata**: Issue types, status categories, and relationships

### 2. Content Flattening and Normalization
- Converts complex JPD JSON structures into flat, searchable text
- Handles ADF content parsing (bullet lists, ordered lists, text blocks)
- Extracts meaningful content from nested JSON structures
- Normalizes data for consistent processing

### 3. Vector Embedding Generation
- Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model for embedding generation
- Creates high-dimensional vector representations of JPD content
- Enables semantic similarity search across product insights
- Supports batch processing of multiple items

### 4. Pinecone Vector Database Integration
- Stores embeddings in Pinecone for efficient similarity search
- Enables semantic querying of product insights
- Supports similarity scoring and ranking
- Facilitates discovery of related product ideas and insights

## Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected components:

### 1. Agent Component
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the overall processing workflow
- **Configuration**: Basic agent setup with GPT-4o model
- **Role**: Coordinates between different processing stages

### 2. Agentic Process (BPMN Workflow)
The main orchestration workflow includes:
- **Get Insight Details**: Extracts JPD item data from Jira
- **Create Insight Embedding**: Generates vector embeddings
- **Query Pinecone**: Performs similarity search and retrieval

### 3. Processing Components

#### Get Insight Details
- Retrieves JPD items from Jira API
- Extracts comprehensive item metadata
- Handles complex JSON structures and relationships

#### Create Insight Embedding
- Processes flattened JPD content
- Generates embeddings using OpenAI API
- Prepares data for vector storage

#### Feed Ideas Into Pinecone
- Stores embeddings in Pinecone vector database
- Manages vector metadata and indexing
- Enables efficient similarity search

#### Query Pinecone
- Performs semantic similarity searches
- Returns ranked results with similarity scores
- Supports various query patterns

## Input/Output Schema

### Input Parameters
The agent accepts various input parameters depending on the operation:
- **idea_id**: Jira issue key (e.g., "STUDPD-5975")
- **idea_details**: Structured JPD item data
- **embeddings**: Vector representations for storage/querying

### Output Schema
The agent produces structured outputs including:
- **idea_details**: Processed and flattened JPD item data
- **embeddings**: Vector representations for similarity search
- **queryEmbeddings**: Search results with similarity scores
- **Error**: Error handling and status information

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Extraction
```
Jira API → Raw JPD JSON → Structured Data Extraction
```

### 2. Content Processing
```
Complex JSON → Flattening → Text Normalization → Searchable Content
```

### 3. Embedding Generation
```
Processed Content → OpenAI Embeddings → Vector Representations
```

### 4. Vector Storage
```
Embeddings → Pinecone Database → Indexed for Similarity Search
```

### 5. Query Processing
```
Search Query → Embedding Generation → Similarity Search → Ranked Results
```
